# Building in Public

There's something powerful about sharing your work before it's "ready."

## The Traditional Approach

Most companies build behind closed doors. They polish every detail, anticipate every edge case, and only reveal their work when it's "perfect."

But perfection is a myth.

## A Better Way

Building in public means:
- **Sharing early** - Get feedback when it matters most
- **Learning faster** - Your community becomes your teacher
- **Building trust** - Transparency creates authentic connections

> "The best way to predict the future is to build it in public." - Unknown

The vulnerability of showing unfinished work is actually your greatest strength.
